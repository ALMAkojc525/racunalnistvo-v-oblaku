Which of the following is an example of virtualization?
answer: d) Multiple virtual machines running on the same server. 
Virtualization represents multiple virtual machines running on the same server meaning that each virtual machine has its own operation system and applications and all of the virtaul machines are installed on one physical server. The VMs run without beeing aware of eachother (similar to having multiple operation systems installed on one PC but these VMS can be run simultaneously) while sharing the same hardware resources using hypervisor software that is responsible for creating each virtual machine and connecting it to the hardware.


Which resources provide the ‘brains’ to process your workloads, including what is required to process and
run requests from applications?
answer: a) Compute
each time we run an application, sand and run requests from applications the computer uses the CPU and RAM to "Compute" the requests and process the workload. the same principle applys to cloud comuting with the difference of having hardware assigned to the virtual machines or using all available hardware (all available processing power of the hardware combined) to process your workload.

When you need to provision a resource within the cloud, _________ makes it almost immediately available
to you to allocate where and when you need it.
answer d) on-denmand resourcing.
Meaining that when you need to user resources it is possible to use all available resources throuh the VM and after you are finished with your task these resources become avialble to others as needed.

A ________ cloud deployment model is where a vendor makes available the use of shared infrastructure,
including compute, storage and network resources, that can be provisioned on demand and typically
accessed over the internet.
answer: d) public
the public deployment model differs from other in case of a privet deployment model the infrastructure is privately hosted, managed and owned by the individual company using it, giving greater and more direct control of its data. where a hybrid could is a model that makes use of both public and private Clouds which is established when a network link is configured between the private cloud to services within the public clound, essentially extending
the logical internal network of the Priv ate Cloud.

How are costs generally charged for cloud resources?
answer: a) Utility-based metering where you only pay for what you use.
If you only have an instance running for two hours, and then shut it down, then you only pay for two hours worth
of compute resources, and that's it.
